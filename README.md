# Bikesharing

Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to show investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We have created a Tableau Story usining NYC bikesharing data that we are planning to use in our presentation.

Results:

We created seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis:

The first two visualizations show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. 

Majority of the bikes are checked out between 4 and 6.

With greater number of male riders.

Here we can see the number of bike trips for all riders for each hour of each day of the week. Looking at the hours it looks like some reiders use bikes to go to and from work.

Now that we split the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week we right away see that there are more male rides than female.

The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week shows us there are more annual subscibers than short-term riders. This should help us predict the customer breakdown in Des Moines.

This bar chart shows us the peak riding hours in August.

This area has more bike rides most likely due to the number of tourists.

Summary:

Creating visualizaritions is a great way to showcase the data and the story helps the audience understand the bigger picture. We were able to demonstrate that starting a bikesharing business is Des Moines is a good idea.
In addition we may create visualizations for the proportion of short term customers to annual subscribers as well as the average trip duration by age. That way we'll have a better understanding who our customers are.
